# Nand2tetris_PartTwo
Software part of the nand2tetris course [https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2]
<br>
A fantastic course highlighting each essential component in building a computer. This part was based on the software abstractions of such. 
<br>
Also tried to learn the Rust programming language through practice. 
<br>
High-level code -> compiler -> VM layer -> VM translator -> Assembler
<br>
Based on the two-layer compilation (similar to Java's JVM).
<br><br>
Uploaded all at once. Next time, do so incrementally.
